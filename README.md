mtasupport-ircbot
=================

The old MTASupport bot in #mta.support on irc.gtanet.com

Just a simple nodejs bot that uses the "irc" library.
There's a config file in here preconfigured for travis for whoever wants to use it to build and push to heroku, just run `travis setup heroku` in the directory to set up deployment.

See commands.js for the commands provided. The entire software isn't built well (in my eyes) so only use this if you're going to enhance it or if you can't be bothered.
